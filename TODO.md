<h3>I/O Methods</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	First of the things we need is input for the potential and the weight function, where potential function just has to satisfy Laplace equation and the weight function is an analogy to the inverse radial dependence in most physical cases.
	<br />
	Unless we are able to manifest a method to take the Taylor/Laurent expansion of any function specified, we also need the facility to take the general? form of their series expansionsi.
	</li>
	<li>
		Would we need an arbitrary precision external, or we use the in-built 'decimal'?
	</li>
	<li>
		Find clever data structures to represent hierarchial octa-tree(3d). A wise man once remarked how a good data structures solves half your algorithmic hurdles. 
	</li>
</ul>
